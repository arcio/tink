TiNK is a game created by Doug Kinnison and Tiago Damasceno. We created this game in 36 total hours for the Global Game Jam 2013. We are posting this so other beginner game developers can see inside the project and learn more about creating games with Unity 3D. ***You will need NGUI to run this and you will also need to be able to build to a mobile platform. This is written with the iPad and windows 8 tablets in mind. Contact me if you need more help.
